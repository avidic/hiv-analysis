Problem Statement: Predicting HIV Prevalence in Adults

The goal of this project is to develop a predictive model to estimate the prevalence of HIV in adults based on various demographic and epidemiological indicators. The dataset contains information on new HIV infections, the number of people living with HIV, AIDS-related deaths, and other relevant factors.

Background:
HIV remains a critical global health challenge, and understanding the factors influencing its prevalence is essential for effective public health interventions. Predicting HIV prevalence in adults can assist health authorities, policymakers, and healthcare practitioners in allocating resources, designing targeted interventions, and implementing preventative measures.

Objective:
The primary objective is to build a machine learning model that can accurately predict whether the prevalence of HIV in adults is above or below a certain threshold. This binary classification task will provide insights into the potential risk factors associated with higher HIV prevalence in specific populations.

Data Description:
The dataset includes demographic information, statistics on new HIV infections, the total number of people living with HIV, the number of HIV-positive children, and the count of AIDS-related deaths across different regions. The target variable is 'Data.HIV Prevalence.Adults,' which represents the prevalence of HIV in adults.

Methods:
Various machine learning algorithms, including logistic regression, support vector machines, and naive Bayes, will be employed to develop predictive models. The dataset will be split into training and testing sets for model evaluation. The performance of each model will be assessed using accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score, and other relevant metrics.

Expected Outcomes:
Upon successful model development, the project aims to provide a tool that can assist healthcare professionals and policymakers in identifying regions or populations at higher risk of elevated HIV prevalence. This predictive capability can guide targeted interventions, resource allocation, and public health strategies aimed at reducing the impact of HIV/AIDS.

Significance:
The successful completion of this project has the potential to contribute valuable insights to public health efforts focused on reducing the prevalence of HIV in adults. By leveraging machine learning techniques, we can enhance our understanding of the complex relationships between demographic factors and HIV prevalence, ultimately leading to more effective strategies for prevention and control.
